there was a capseller he was travelling for quite long, which made him very tired so he decided to take nap under tree.
when he wakes up he finds all his caps are missing and tries to find where the hats are, he found that a bunch of monkeys have stolen his caps.
 to get his caps back he does throwing because monkeys imitate so they throw the hat and he gets all his hat back.
 The end.
